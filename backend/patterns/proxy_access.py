"""Proxy Pattern for access control and route gating.

AccessProxy centralizes logic deciding whether a user can access certain public
pages (e.g., home landing) based on role and contextual ownership state.

Using a proxy instead of scattering conditional checks across routes provides:
- Single responsibility for access decisions
- Easier extension (add more rules: subscription tiers, feature flags, etc.)
- Clear separation between presentation and access enforcement

Pattern Participants:
- Subject (original route handler): The underlying function generating content
- Proxy (AccessProxy): Intercepts call, performs role/security checks, may redirect

Current Rules Implemented:
- Business owners are redirected away from public home pages to their dashboard
  or business creation flow depending on whether they have a business.
